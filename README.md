# MRI Segmentation
Tartu University ML course final proyect

MRI image segmentation using Deep Learning.

The main idea is to compare how a pretrained backbond can improve the performance of a DL model for segmentations.

Model.py describes the models
Dataset.py creates the dataset
train.py defines the training phase usign the dataset defined in dataset.py and model defined in model.py

In the shared folder a singularity file can be found with all the dependencies.
